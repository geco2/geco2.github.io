I've been thinking about a blog for some time now. There are so many impressions and ideas I am not able to follow them directly when they pass my mind. So the idea is to make a "backup" of them and make them available to everyone who's interested.
 
I am a technologist with a passion for change, the maker and hacker scene. Most likely, most of the content in this blog will focus on such topics. Other interests such as politics, ethics and general brain food will be added from time to time. It is not my intention to use the text for marketing purposes myself or as part of my job. It is only me personally, my thoughts and experiences that I have shared with other people.
