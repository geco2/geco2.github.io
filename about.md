# About page

I am a technologist with passion for change, the maker and hacker scene. Most likely, most of the content in this blog will focus on such topics. Other interests such as politics, ethics and general brain food will be added from time to time. It is not my intention to use the text for marketing purposes myself or as part of my job. 
It is only me personally, my thoughts and experiences that I have shared with other people.

I decided to not self-host my blog cause i don't want to take care of any infrastructure. As I'm a big fan of simplification i really like the idea to make use of GitHub, git in general and a simple format to actually create my content. That is why you read this lines on github.io.

Spelling is most likely worse, specially when you read this as a native speaker. That is cause I'm a German with only limited skill in the English language. That is a challenge during my day to day job as well as creating content here. It always feels bad cause I'm only able to use simple words to transport (more or less) complex ideas. Imagine a 5 year old girl lecture quantum computing - That is how it feel for me. Hope you are OK and can generously disregard it.
And yes, i just write in vim, without any spellcheck software (subject to change ;-) maybe later).
